# Setup swe-swe Environment

Help the user configure their development environment conversationally.

## Tasks

1. **Inject swe-swe pointer** (if not present)
   - Check if /workspace/CLAUDE.md or /workspace/AGENTS.md exists
   - If exists and doesn't mention .swe-swe/docs/AGENTS.md, append:
     ```
     ## swe-swe
     See `.swe-swe/docs/AGENTS.md` for commands and setup.
     ```
   - If neither exists, create /workspace/CLAUDE.md or /workspace/AGENT.md
     (whichever is applicable to the current agent) with the pointer

2. **Git identity**
   - Check `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
   - If not set, ask user and configure
   - Ask about GPG signing preference

3. **SSH keys**
   - Check if ~/.ssh/id_* exists
   - If not, offer to generate
   - Help add to ssh-agent
   - Provide public key for GitHub/GitLab

4. **Testing setup**
   - Ask: what command starts your dev server?
   - Ask: what port does it run on?
   - Document how to access via host.docker.internal
   - See `.swe-swe/docs/browser-automation.md` for MCP browser details

5. **Update .swe-swe/docs/AGENTS.md**
   - Update the "Current Setup" section with configured values

## Style

Be conversational. Ask one thing at a time. Skip what's already configured.
