= swe-swe Bundled Slash Commands

This directory contains slash commands that ship with swe-swe.

These commands are automatically installed to `~/.claude/commands/swe-swe/` during `swe-swe init`.

== Reserved Namespace

The `swe-swe` namespace is reserved. Using `--with-slash-commands=swe-swe@...` will result in an error.

== Adding Commands

To add a new bundled command, create a `.md` file in this directory. The file will be embedded in the swe-swe binary and extracted during init.
