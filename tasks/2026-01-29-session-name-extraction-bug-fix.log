082614 - Starting fix for session-name-extraction-bug
082614 - Will fix extractOwnerRepo() in main.go:2906-2935 to handle SSH URLs with subdirectories
082614 - Expected: SSH URLs like git@gitlab.com:group/subgroup/owner/repo should return "owner/repo" (last 2 segments)
082803 - Applied fix: SSH case now extracts last 2 path segments just like HTTPS case
082803 - Ran make build golden-update: SUCCESS
082803 - Ran make test: ALL TESTS PASS
082803 - Golden files show correct diff: extractOwnerRepo() fixed at lines 2909-2923
083109 - VERIFICATION: This is a pure function fix (unit test cases in task file)
083109 - No MCP browser test specified in task - fix verified via code review and test suite
083109 - Code change: SSH URLs now split pathPart by "/" and take last 2 segments
083109 - Example: git@gitlab.com:group/subgroup/owner/repo -> "owner/repo" (not "group/subgroup/owner/repo")
083109 - CONCLUSION: Fix verified correct
