095000 Starting Phase 6: Cleanup and Golden Tests
       Steps:
       1. Remove --basic-ui golden test variants (already done in Phase 1)
       2. Update Makefile (already done in Phase 1)
       3. Remove --basic-ui from test-container script
       4. Clean up task log files (keeping for historical reference)
       5. Run make build golden-update
       6. Review golden diffs
       7. Run full test suite
       8. Final manual verification with test container (already done in Phase 5)
       9. Search for any remaining references
       Expected: No --basic-ui references in code; clean golden tests

095500 Phase 6 implementation complete. Changes made:
       - Updated comment in main.go template: "for basic-ui mode" -> "for split-pane preview"
       - Updated example flag in test-container/01-init.sh: "--basic-ui" -> "--status-bar-color=red"
       - Regenerated all golden test files
       - Left BasicUiUrl escape sequence API intact for backward compatibility
         (documented in .swe-swe/docs/app-preview.md)

       Cleanup verification:
       - No --basic-ui references in source code (grep confirms)
       - No with-basic-ui golden test directories (removed in Phase 1)
       - Task log files retained for historical reference
       - make test passes
       - make build golden-update completed

       Phase 6 complete. All acceptance criteria met:
       ✓ make test passes
       ✓ make build golden-update completed
       ✓ No --basic-ui references in source code
       ✓ All golden outputs have split-pane structure
       ✓ All golden outputs include app-preview.md
       ✓ Manual verification passed (Phase 5 testing covers this)
