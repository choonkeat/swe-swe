072917 Starting Phase 1: Host Infrastructure
072917 Step 1.1: Add activeRequests atomic counter and processEntry struct
072917 Expected: Code compiles, existing tests pass
073221 Observed: Code compiles for all platforms (linux, darwin, windows), all tests pass
073221 Got: PASS - Added atomic.Int32 activeRequests, processEntry struct, sync.Map inFlightProcesses
073221 Note: Created proxy_unix.go and proxy_windows.go for platform-specific Setpgid handling

073236 Step 1.2: Add unit tests for Phase 1 infrastructure
073236 Expected: Tests verify counter behavior, process registry, process group setup
073335 Observed: All 4 new tests pass (TestActiveRequestCounter, TestActiveRequestCounter_Concurrent, TestProcessRegistry, TestProcessGroupSetup)
073335 Got: PASS - All Phase 1 tests verify infrastructure works correctly

073335 Phase 1 COMPLETE
