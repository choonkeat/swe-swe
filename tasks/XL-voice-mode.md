# Feature: Voice Mode for Input and Output

## Overview
Enable voice-based interaction where users can speak their prompts and hear agent responses read aloud. This feature requires intelligent handling of technical content, especially tool outputs which are often verbose and not suitable for text-to-speech.

## Key Features

### 1. Voice Input
- Push-to-talk or voice activity detection options
- Real-time speech-to-text transcription display
- Support for voice commands (e.g., "stop", "pause")
- Language detection and multi-language support
- Ability to edit transcribed text before sending

### 2. Voice Output
- Text-to-speech for agent responses
- Intelligent content filtering for readability
- Adjustable speech rate and voice selection
- Pause/resume/skip controls
- Visual highlighting of spoken text

### 3. Tool Output Handling
- **Summarization Mode**: Convert tool outputs to concise summaries
  - "Ran git status - 5 files modified, 2 untracked"
  - "Read file config.js - 150 lines"
  - "Executed build command - completed successfully"
- **Skip Mode**: Omit tool outputs entirely from speech
- **Smart Mode**: Speak only errors or important results
- Visual-only display for full tool outputs remains available

### 4. Content Adaptation Rules
```yaml
speechRules:
  code_blocks:
    small: read_simplified  # "function getName returns string"
    large: summarize        # "20-line function that handles user input"
  file_paths:
    speak_as: basename_only # "/src/utils/helper.js" â†’ "helper.js"
  tool_outputs:
    bash: summarize_result
    read: announce_file_only
    write: confirm_action
    search: result_count_only
  technical_terms:
    spell_out: ["API", "URL", "JSON"]
    pronounce_as:
      "git": "git"
      "npm": "N-P-M"
      "src": "source"
```

### 5. Voice Commands
- "Stop reading" - stops current TTS
- "Repeat that" - re-reads last segment
- "Skip to end" - jumps to final summary
- "Pause/Resume" - controls TTS playback
- "Read the code" - switches to verbose mode temporarily

## Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition
- Web Speech API or cloud service integration
- Fallback to manual input on error
- Background noise handling
- Custom vocabulary for technical terms

### Text-to-Speech Engine
- High-quality voices with code pronunciation
- SSML support for better control
- Chunking for long responses
- Pre-processing pipeline for technical content

### Content Processing Pipeline
```javascript
function prepareSpeechContent(agentResponse) {
  return response
    .filterToolOutputs()
    .summarizeCodeBlocks()
    .expandAcronyms()
    .simplifyPaths()
    .addProsodyMarks()
    .chunkBySentence();
}
```

## User Interface

### Visual Components
- Microphone button with recording indicator
- Waveform visualization during speech
- TTS playback controls
- Speech/text mode toggle
- Volume and rate sliders

### Status Indicators
- "Listening..." during voice input
- "Processing..." during recognition
- Current word highlighting during TTS
- Tool output summary badges

## Accessibility Benefits
- Hands-free operation for mobility impaired users
- Screen reader alternative
- Reduced eye strain option
- Multi-tasking enablement

## Configuration
```yaml
voiceMode:
  enabled: false
  input:
    engine: "browser" | "cloud"
    language: "en-US"
    continuous: false
    pushToTalk: true
  output:
    engine: "browser" | "elevenlabs" | "azure"
    voice: "default"
    rate: 1.0
    pitch: 1.0
    toolOutputMode: "summary" | "skip" | "smart"
    codeBlockMode: "summary" | "simplified" | "skip"
```

## Edge Cases
- Network interruption during cloud TTS/STT
- Simultaneous speech and permission dialogs
- Code with unusual syntax or symbols
- Multi-language code comments
- Speaking while agent is speaking
- Very long agent responses

## Privacy Considerations
- Local vs. cloud processing options
- Audio data retention policies
- Opt-in for cloud services
- Clear privacy indicators

### Breakdown
- **Speech Recognition Integration**: L
  - Browser API integration
  - Cloud service fallback
  - Technical vocabulary training
  
- **TTS Engine Integration**: L
  - Content pre-processing pipeline
  - SSML generation
  - Voice selection and configuration
  
- **Content Adaptation System**: L
  - Tool output summarization
  - Code simplification rules
  - Context-aware filtering
  
- **UI/UX Development**: M
  - Voice controls interface

### Impact Analysis
- **User Experience**: Very high positive impact for accessibility
- **Codebase Changes**: Major - new audio subsystem
- **Architecture**: High impact - new processing pipeline
- **Performance Risk**: Medium - audio processing overhead

### Agent-Era Estimation Notes
This is "Extra Large" because:
- Complex integration with multiple external APIs
- Extensive content transformation rules needed
- Accessibility requirements demand high quality
- Many subjective UX decisions about what to speak/skip
- Cross-platform audio handling complexity
- Privacy and security implications
