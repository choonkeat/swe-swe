085128 - STEP 4: Verifying golden file diff shows only expected worktree -> worktrees change
Expected: Diff shows only 'worktree' -> 'worktrees' in external repo paths (comments and code)
085146 - SUCCESS: Diff verification passed
Got: Only these unique line changes:
  -// For external repos, use worktree subdirectory within the repo
  +// For external repos, use worktrees subdirectory within the repo
  -// e.g., /repos/github.com-user-repo/worktree/feature-branch
  +// e.g., /repos/github.com-user-repo/worktrees/feature-branch
  -return filepath.Join(filepath.Dir(repoPath), "worktree", worktreeDirName(branchName))
  +return filepath.Join(filepath.Dir(repoPath), "worktrees", worktreeDirName(branchName))
