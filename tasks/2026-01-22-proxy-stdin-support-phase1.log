# Phase 1 Log: stdin support for swe-swe proxy

## Step 1.1: Add integration test for stdin (RED)

### Before test creation
- Time: Starting step 1.1
- Action: Adding integration test that pipes stdin to a proxied command
- Expected: Test will FAIL because stdin forwarding is not yet implemented

### After test run (032931)
- Observed: All 3 stdin tests FAILED as expected
- TestIntegration_StdinForwarding: expected "hello from stdin\n", got ""
- TestIntegration_StdinMultiline: expected "line1\nline2\nline3\n", got ""
- TestIntegration_StdinWithArgs: expected "3" lines, got "0"
- Conclusion: RED phase confirmed - stdin not forwarded, tests correctly detect this
