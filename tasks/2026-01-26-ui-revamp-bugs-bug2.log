231932 - Bug 2 Investigation Complete
What will be done: Add visible chat button to header when viewers > 1
Expected outcome:
- Chat icon/button should appear in header when there are 2+ viewers
- Clicking the button should toggle the chat input overlay
- Button should show unread message badge when new messages arrive
- Chat functionality (send/receive) should continue working as before

Investigation findings:
- Chat is NOT broken - fully implemented on frontend and backend
- WebSocket chat messages work (type: 'chat')
- Chat overlay, input field, and JavaScript functions all present
- The issue is discoverability - "X others" link is hidden in legacy status bar
- Need to add a visible chat trigger in the new header design

Key files:
- terminal-ui.js: Add chat button HTML, modify updateHeader to show/hide it
- terminal-ui.css: Add styles for chat button and unread badge
