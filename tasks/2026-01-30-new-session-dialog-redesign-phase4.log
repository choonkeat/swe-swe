003900 PLAN: Implementing Phase 4 — CSS: Styling adjustments
  - Add placeholder styling for select when value is empty
  - Inline Next buttons already work with existing flex layout
  - Hidden field groups already use dialog__field--hidden
  - Expected: make build golden-update succeeds, visual polish confirmed in Phase 5

  - Added :invalid / placeholder styling for muted color on placeholder select
  - Added required attribute to select for :invalid pseudo-class
  - Added compact inline Next button style (.dialog__row .dialog__next)
  - Added disabled option styling
