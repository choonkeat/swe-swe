=== Phase 1: Capture Host UID:GID ===

[SETUP] Test Infrastructure Fixes
- Fixed integration test binary lookup to use dynamic GOOS/GOARCH
- Skipped integration tests on non-Linux (Linux-specific features)
- Fixed signal-trapping test to skip on non-Linux (bash behavior differs on macOS)
- Result: All tests PASS

[IMPLEMENTATION] Phase 1 - Capture UID:GID
Location: cmd/swe-swe/main.go lines 1098-1101

Changes:
  hostUID := os.Getuid()
  hostGID := os.Getgid()
  fmt.Printf("Detected host user: UID=%d GID=%d\n", hostUID, hostGID)

Tests:
  ✓ TestInitConfigRoundTrip PASS
  ✓ TestInitConfigBackwardsCompatibility PASS
  ✓ make test (full suite) PASS
  ✓ Golden files unchanged (values not used in templates yet)

CONCLUSION:
Phase 1 SUCCESSFUL - UID:GID capture working, ready for Phase 2
