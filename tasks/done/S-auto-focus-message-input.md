# Feature: Auto-focus Message Input After Agent Response

## Overview
Automatically set focus to the message input field whenever the agent completes its response iteration (when the typing indicator disappears). This improves the user experience by allowing immediate typing without requiring a manual click.

## Key Features

### 1. Focus Trigger Events
- Focus when typing indicator transitions from visible to hidden
- Focus when agent response stream completes
- Focus when error messages are displayed
- Maintain focus if user is already interacting with other UI elements

### 2. User Experience Considerations
- Respect user intent - don't steal focus if user is:
  - Selecting text in the agent's response
  - Interacting with code blocks (copying, etc.)
  - Using keyboard shortcuts for other actions
  - Scrolling through the conversation
- Smooth focus transition without jarring viewport changes

### 3. Edge Cases to Handle
- Multiple rapid agent responses
- Focus during ongoing file operations
- Focus when modals or popups are active
- Mobile/tablet touch interactions
- Screen reader compatibility

### 4. Configuration
- Allow users to disable auto-focus behavior
- Configurable delay before focus (default: 0ms)
- Option to include visual focus indicator

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Event Handling
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for focus management
onAgentResponseComplete(() => {
  if (shouldAutoFocus()) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      messageInput.focus();
    }, config.focusDelay);
  }
});
```

### Focus Conditions
- Agent response fully rendered
- No active user selection
- No modal/popup active
- User hasn't manually focused elsewhere
- Not in code block interaction mode

## Benefits
- Faster user interaction flow
- Reduced mouse/trackpad usage
- Better keyboard-driven workflow
- Improved accessibility for keyboard users

## Potential Issues
- May interfere with copy/paste workflows
- Could be disruptive during response review
- Mobile keyboard popup behavior

## Estimation

### T-Shirt Size: S (Small)

### Breakdown
- **Core Implementation**: XS
  - Event listener for response completion
  - Focus method call
  
- **Edge Case Handling**: S
  - User interaction detection
  - Focus stealing prevention
  
- **Testing**: S
  - Cross-browser focus behavior
  - Accessibility testing
  - Mobile keyboard handling

### Impact Analysis
- **User Experience**: Medium positive impact
- **Codebase Changes**: Minimal - single feature addition
- **Architecture**: No impact - UI layer only
- **Performance Risk**: None

### Agent-Era Estimation Notes
This remains "Small" because:
- Well-defined browser API usage
- Limited integration points
- Clear success criteria
- Minimal architectural decisions
