# Phase 2 Execution Log: Create bundled slash command files

012004: Starting Phase 2 execution
- Will create cmd/swe-swe/slash-commands/swe-swe/setup.md for Claude/Codex/OpenCode
- Will create cmd/swe-swe/slash-commands/swe-swe/setup.toml for Gemini
- Will update entrypoint.sh template to install files to agent directories
- Will verify embed directive includes both .md and .toml files
- Expected: Golden tests show new files in home/.claude/commands/swe-swe/, etc.

012301: Phase 2 implementation complete
- Created cmd/swe-swe/slash-commands/swe-swe/setup.md
- Created cmd/swe-swe/slash-commands/swe-swe/setup.toml
- Modified writeBundledSlashCommands to accept extension filter parameter
- Updated call site in main.go to install to 4 agent directories:
  - ~/.claude/commands/ (.md)
  - ~/.codex/prompts/ (.md)
  - ~/.config/opencode/command/ (.md)
  - ~/.gemini/commands/ (.toml)
- Updated test to verify both .md and .toml file handling
- make build: SUCCESS
- make test: ALL TESTS PASS
- Note: Embed directive already uses "all:slash-commands" which includes all files
