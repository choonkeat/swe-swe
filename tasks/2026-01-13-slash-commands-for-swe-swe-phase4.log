# Phase 4 Execution Log: Simplify .swe-swe/docs/AGENTS.md

012557: Starting Phase 4 execution
- Will update cmd/swe-swe/templates/container/.swe-swe/docs/AGENTS.md
- Will remove "For Agents" section with @swe-swe/<command> syntax
- Will simplify to just list available commands without invocation syntax
- Expected: MOTD teaches syntax, AGENTS.md just lists what's available
