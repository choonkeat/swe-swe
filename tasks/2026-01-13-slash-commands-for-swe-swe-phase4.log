# Phase 4 Execution Log: Simplify .swe-swe/docs/AGENTS.md

012557: Starting Phase 4 execution
- Will update cmd/swe-swe/templates/container/.swe-swe/docs/AGENTS.md
- Will remove "For Agents" section with @swe-swe/<command> syntax
- Will simplify to just list available commands without invocation syntax
- Expected: MOTD teaches syntax, AGENTS.md just lists what's available

012640: Phase 4 implementation complete
- Simplified AGENTS.md content:
  - Removed "Use @swe-swe/<command> to invoke:" instructions
  - Removed "Where" column from commands table
  - Removed worktree commands (merge-this-worktree, discard-this-worktree)
  - Removed "For Agents" section entirely
  - Kept: Commands table, Current Setup section, Documentation list
- make build: SUCCESS
- make test: ALL TESTS PASS
