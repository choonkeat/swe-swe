080317 - Phase 1: Implement the fix in cmd/swe-swe/init.go
Action: Add .swe-swe/repos directory creation when --repos-dir is NOT specified
        Also add .swe-swe/worktrees directory creation (related issue mentioned in task)
Expected: Code compiles, creates repos dir only when --repos-dir flag is empty

080401 - Observation: Code edit applied successfully
Result: make test PASSED - all tests pass, code compiles correctly

080447 - Golden update check: No golden file changes (expected - host directories not in golden output)
Phase 1 complete: Code fix implemented and tests pass
