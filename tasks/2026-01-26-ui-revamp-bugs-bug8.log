## Bug 8: Agent Label Missing Safe/YOLO Indicator - Investigation & Fix Log

### 2026-01-26 23:38 - Investigation Phase

**What will be done**: Investigate how the agent badge is rendered and where autoApprove mode is stored, then update the badge to display the mode.

**Expected outcome**: Agent badge should display "CLAUDE (safe)" or "CLAUDE (YOLO)" instead of just "CLAUDE".
