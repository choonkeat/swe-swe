115709 | STEP: Add Back/Forward buttons to preview toolbar HTML and JS event handlers | EXPECT: Buttons appear in toolbar between Home and Refresh, clicking them calls iframe.contentWindow.history.back()/forward()
120007 | RESULT: Verified via MCP browser at http://swe-swe:3000/session/test-backfwd?assistant=claude&preview
       | - DOM confirmed 6 buttons in correct order: Home, Back, Forward, Refresh, Go, Open External
       | - iframe-location toolbar display:flex after clicking preview tab
       | - back.click() and forward.click() execute without errors
       | - Buttons 0x0 visually because dev server uses -no-preview-proxy (right panel has no width) — expected in dev mode
       | - Full visual verification requires running container with preview proxy (out of scope for this task)
       | CONCLUSION: Implementation correct. Buttons in DOM, handlers wired, correct order.
