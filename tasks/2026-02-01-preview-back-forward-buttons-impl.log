115709 | STEP: Add Back/Forward buttons to preview toolbar HTML and JS event handlers | EXPECT: Buttons appear in toolbar between Home and Refresh, clicking them calls iframe.contentWindow.history.back()/forward()
120007 | RESULT (incomplete): DOM-only check. Buttons in DOM in correct order but toolbar had 0 width — right pane wasn't open.
       | - Reason: ?preview mode has no WebSocket delivering BroadcastStatus/previewPort, so the split pane never auto-opens.
120317 | REDO: Forced pane open via el.openIframePane('preview', null) at 1400x900 viewport. Took screenshot.
       | - Screenshot confirms toolbar VISUALLY VISIBLE with correct button order:
       |   ⌂ Home | ◀ Back | ▶ Forward | ↻ Refresh | [Enter URL...] | → Go | ↗ Open External
       | - iframe shows placeholder (no preview proxy in dev mode) — no navigation test possible yet.
120500 | STEP: Functional navigation test — build history in iframe, test Back/Forward buttons change the page
       | - Loaded same-origin SPA in iframe (about:blank + doc.write + pushState) with 3 pages: A, B, C
       | - Navigated A → B → C via link clicks
       | EXPECT: ◀ Back goes C→B→A, ▶ Forward goes A→B→C
120842 | RESULT: Navigation test PASSED
       | - ◀ Back clicked: Page C → Page B (heading changed to "Page B", body "Back to B")
       | - ◀ Back clicked: Page B → Page A (heading changed to "Page A", body "Back to start")
       | - ▶ Forward clicked: Page A → Page B (heading changed to "Page B", body "Back to B")
       | - ▶ Forward clicked: Page B → Page C (heading changed to "Page C", body "Back to C")
       | - Final screenshot confirms Page C visible with toolbar buttons
       | NOTE: Cross-origin iframes (different port) block contentWindow.history access. In production
       |   the preview proxy makes iframe same-origin, so this works. Verified same-origin works here.
       | CONCLUSION: Back/Forward buttons fully functional. Visual + navigation verification both passed.
