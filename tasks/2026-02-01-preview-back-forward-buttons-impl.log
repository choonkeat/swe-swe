115709 | STEP: Add Back/Forward buttons to preview toolbar HTML and JS event handlers | EXPECT: Buttons appear in toolbar between Home and Refresh, clicking them calls iframe.contentWindow.history.back()/forward()
120007 | RESULT (incomplete): DOM-only check. Buttons in DOM in correct order but toolbar had 0 width — right pane wasn't open.
       | - Reason: ?preview mode has no WebSocket delivering BroadcastStatus/previewPort, so the split pane never auto-opens.
120317 | REDO: Forced pane open via el.openIframePane('preview', null) at 1400x900 viewport. Took screenshot.
       | - Screenshot confirms toolbar VISUALLY VISIBLE with correct button order:
       |   ⌂ Home | ◀ Back | ▶ Forward | ↻ Refresh | [Enter URL...] | → Go | ↗ Open External
       | - back.click() and forward.click() execute without errors
       | - iframe shows placeholder (no preview proxy in dev mode) which is expected
       | CONCLUSION: Visual verification passed. Buttons render correctly in the toolbar.
