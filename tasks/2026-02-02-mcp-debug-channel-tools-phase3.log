153757 START Phase 3: Config plumbing + golden-update + test container e2e
153757 PLAN: (1) Update .mcp.json, (2) Update entrypoint.sh for all platforms, (3) Sharpen skill descriptions, (4) make build golden-update, (5) make test, (6) test container e2e
153757 EXPECT: golden diffs show new swe-swe-preview MCP server entry in configs. make test passes.
154004 DONE: Config plumbing (steps 1-3): Updated .mcp.json, entrypoint.sh (OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, Goose), skill descriptions
154004 RAN: make build golden-update — 224 files changed across all golden variants
154004 VERIFY: golden diffs show only expected changes: swe-swe-preview MCP server entries, updated skill descriptions, main.go MCP code
154004 RAN: make test — both test suites pass (ok cmd/swe-swe 43.498s, ok swe-swe 2.344s), no FAILs
154004 REMAINING: Test container e2e (steps 7-14) — requires user involvement for manual browser testing
154100 START: Test container e2e (steps 7-14)
154100 PLAN: init → build → run → browser test → verify agent discovers preview_query
154100 EXPECT: Agent calls preview_query (not browser_snapshot) when asked about preview content
154843 RAN: Test container init → build → run — all succeeded, container at http://host.docker.internal:9770/
154843 RAN: Created OpenCode session, typed "run a python web server on localhost:3100 that serves an index.html saying Hello from Preview"
154843 RESULT: Agent created server.py, started it, preview shows "Hello from Preview" — PASS
154843 RAN: Typed "what's showing on my preview page?"
154843 RESULT: Agent used swe-swe-playwright_browser_navigate (NOT preview_query) — FAIL
154843 OBSERVED: Agent called browser_navigate twice, then browser_install. Did not discover or use preview_query.
154843 NOTE: Status bar shows "2 MCP" confirming both MCP servers are connected. Agent chose Playwright over preview_query despite both being available.
154843 NEXT: Per task plan step 13, need to iterate on tool description string to improve discoverability. Stopping for user consultation.
155300 ITERATION 1: Updated descriptions to mirror Playwright style with "Preview tab" specificity
155300 preview_query: "Capture a snapshot of the Preview tab content by CSS selector... browser_snapshot cannot see Preview tab content."
155300 preview_listen: "Returns console logs, errors, and network requests from the Preview tab... browser_console_messages cannot see Preview tab output."
155300 RAN: Teardown → make build → 01-init → 02-build → 03-run. Verified new descriptions in running container.
155723 RAN: New session, started server on :3101, preview shows "Hello from Preview". Asked "what's showing on my preview page?"
155723 RESULT: Agent used swe-swe-playwright_browser_navigate again (NOT preview_query) — FAIL
155723 ANALYSIS: Description change alone insufficient. Agent gravitates to Playwright's browser_navigate/browser_snapshot because it has many familiar browser_* tools. The preview_query tool exists in a separate MCP server with only 2 tools — likely gets overshadowed.
232000 ITERATION 2: Renamed tools to browser_debug_preview and browser_debug_preview_listen, changed "Preview tab" to "Preview" in descriptions
232000 RAN: Teardown → make build → 01-init → 02-build → 03-run. Verified new names in container: browser_debug_preview, browser_debug_preview_listen. 2 MCP confirmed.
232204 RAN: New session, started server on :3100, preview shows "Hello from Preview". Asked "what's showing on my preview page?"
232204 RESULT: Agent used swe-swe-playwright_browser_navigate again (NOT browser_debug_preview) — FAIL
232204 ANALYSIS: Neither description changes nor browser_* namespace renaming affects tool selection. OpenCode's underlying model treats "preview page" as a browser navigation task and reaches for Playwright. The issue is not discoverability of tool names/descriptions but rather the model's ingrained association between "page inspection" and browser_navigate/browser_snapshot.
232500 ITERATION 3: Switched to Claude agent (--agents=claude) with same tool names/descriptions as iteration 2
232500 RAN: Teardown → 01-init (SWE_SWE_INIT_FLAGS="--agents=claude") → 02-build → 03-run. Claude requires OAuth login.
232500 RAN: User authenticated via platform.claude.com OAuth flow. Claude Code v2.1.29 (Opus 4.5) ready.
232500 RAN: Asked agent to create python web server on :3100 with form + text input. Agent created index.html, started server. Preview shows "My Form" with input field.
232500 RAN: Typed "purple elephant dancing" into preview's text input field (only visible in preview, not in source HTML).
232500 RAN: Asked "what text did I type into the input field on my preview page?"
232500 RESULT: Agent used swe-swe-preview - browser_debug_preview (MCP)(selector: "input") — PASS! Correct tool selected.
232500 NOTE: Claude correctly chose browser_debug_preview over Playwright tools. However, the debug channel returned the input as "empty" — the DOM query doesn't capture live .value property of form inputs. This is a separate implementation issue, not a tool selection issue.
232500 CONCLUSION: Tool discoverability works with Claude (Opus 4.5). OpenCode's model does not discover the tool across 3 iterations. The browser_debug_preview naming + description is sufficient for Claude.
233000 ITERATION 4: OpenCode with better test scenario (user-typed input in preview, not static page content)
233000 RAN: Teardown → 01-init (default OpenCode) → 02-build → 03-run. Created session, server on :3100 with form + text input.
233000 RAN: Typed "purple elephant dancing" into preview's text input field. Asked "what text did I type into the input field on my preview page?"
233000 RESULT: Agent used NO tools at all. Responded: "I can't see what text you typed into the input field on your preview page." — FAIL (different failure mode)
233000 NOTE: OpenCode didn't try Playwright OR browser_debug_preview. It gave up entirely, saying it doesn't have access to monitor browser preview content. The bash timeout on the python server may have confused the model context.
233000 FINAL SUMMARY: Claude discovers and uses browser_debug_preview correctly. OpenCode does not, regardless of scenario or tool naming. This appears to be a model-level difference in tool discovery behavior.
