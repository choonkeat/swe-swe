Bug 9: Reconnecting Status Shows Raw HTML

=== Investigation ===
[103000] Starting investigation of Bug 9
- What will be done: Find where reconnecting status message is set and fix HTML escaping issue
- Expected: Status should display plain text like "Reconnecting to OpenCode in 34s..."
- Current: Status displays raw HTML tags because textContent is used with HTML string

[103001] Root cause identified:
- In terminal-ui.js line 604-605, updateStatus() uses `statusText.textContent = message`
- But the message contains HTML from getAssistantLink() which returns `<a href="...">name</a>`
- textContent treats HTML as literal text, showing raw tags
- Fix: Create getAssistantName() method that returns plain text name for status messages

=== Implementation ===
[103002] Fix implemented:
1. Added getAssistantName() method at line 670-673 that returns plain text name
2. Updated scheduleReconnect() at lines 680 and 685 to use getAssistantName()
3. Updated connect() at line 730 to use getAssistantName()
4. Build completed successfully

=== Verification Plan ===
[103003] Will verify via browser testing:
- Start test container
- Navigate to a session page
- Trigger reconnection (e.g., disconnect WebSocket)
- Expected: Status text should show plain text like "Reconnecting to OpenCode in 34s..."
- Should NOT show raw HTML tags
