232503 - Bug 4 Investigation Complete
What will be done: Combine URL display and input into single editable field
Expected outcome:
- Single URL input field that shows current URL and allows editing
- Remove separate read-only URL span
- Keep home, refresh, and go buttons
- Input value updates when iframe URL changes
- User can edit input and press Enter or click Go to navigate

Investigation findings:
- Currently has separate span (terminal-ui__iframe-url) and input (terminal-ui__iframe-url-input)
- The span shows current URL, input is for debugging external URLs
- Need to merge into single input that does both
- Input should be pre-populated with current iframe URL
- When URL changes, input should update to reflect new location

Key files:
- terminal-ui.js: Modify HTML structure and JS to use single input
- terminal-ui.css: May need style adjustments for combined element
