090000 Starting Phase 5: Sync Settings Panel with Status Bar
       Steps:
       1. Audit current settings panel structure
       2. Remove basic-ui specific elements from settings panel
       3. Update settings panel navigation
       4. Apply same click behavior to settings panel links
       5. Add preview settings section (if appropriate)
       6. Visual consistency (active indicator sync)
       7. Test settings panel <-> status bar sync
       Expected: Settings panel navigation matches status bar exactly

091500 Phase 5 implementation complete. Changes made:
       - Added Shell tab to settings panel navigation HTML (💻 Shell)
       - Added data-tab attributes to all service tabs (shell, vscode, preview, browser)
       - Added settings-panel__nav-shell class for shell link
       - Updated populateSettingsPanel() to:
         - Set dynamic URL for shell tab (derived UUID with parent param)
         - Hide shell tab when already in a shell session (this.assistant === 'shell')
         - Set dynamic URLs for preview and browser tabs
       - Added click handlers for all nav tabs that call handleTabClick()
       - Settings panel closes after clicking a tab (calls closeSettingsPanel())
       - Fixed typo: hideSettings() -> closeSettingsPanel()
       - Updated updateActiveTabIndicator() to sync both status bar AND settings panel
       - Added CSS for .settings-panel__nav-btn.active (background highlight + border)

       Manual browser verification PASSED:
       - Settings panel shows all 5 tabs: Home, Shell, VSCode, Preview, Browser
       - Click Shell in settings panel -> iframe opens with shell session
       - Settings panel closes automatically after clicking tab
       - Terminal resizes from 120×35 to 59×35 (split pane active)
       - Active indicator shows on both status bar "shell" link AND settings panel "Shell" tab
       - Click active "shell" in status bar -> iframe closes, terminal full width (119×35)
       - Active indicator cleared from both locations
