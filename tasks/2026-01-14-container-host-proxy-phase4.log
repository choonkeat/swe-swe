111800 - Phase 4: Integration Testing
Action: Create proxy_integration_test.go with end-to-end tests
Expected: All tests pass via `go test -v ./cmd/swe-swe -run Integration`

111830 - Phase 4 Step 1: Test harness
Observed:
- proxyTestHelper struct to manage proxy lifecycle
- newProxyTestHelper creates temp directory structure
- startProxy() starts proxy binary, waits for script generation
- stopProxy() sends SIGTERM and waits
- runContainerScript() executes generated script with args
Got: As expected. Test harness working.

111845 - Phase 4 Tests Created:
- TestIntegration_BasicFlow: echo hello world -> stdout captured, exit 0
- TestIntegration_ExitCodePropagation: sh -c "exit 42" -> exit code 42
- TestIntegration_StdoutStderrSeparation: stdout and stderr correctly separated
- TestIntegration_ConcurrentRequests: 5 parallel requests all complete
- TestIntegration_SpecialCharacters: spaces, equals, quotes, newlines, unicode all work
- TestIntegration_NoArguments: empty request file works
- TestIntegration_CommandNotFound: returns exit code 127
- TestIntegration_GracefulShutdown: in-flight request completes before exit

111900 - Phase 4: Result
Observed:
- All 8 integration tests pass
- Full test suite passes: `make test` shows all green
- Tests cover: basic flow, exit codes, stdout/stderr, concurrency, special chars, edge cases
Got: As expected. Phase 4 complete - all integration tests passing.

Implementation Summary:
- proxy.go: 325 lines (core implementation)
- proxy_test.go: 232 lines (unit tests for Phases 1-3)
- proxy_integration_test.go: 273 lines (integration tests for Phase 4)
- Total: ~830 lines of Go code

All 4 phases complete:
- Phase 1: Core Host Proxy ✅
- Phase 2: Container Script Generation ✅
- Phase 3: Error Handling & Cleanup ✅
- Phase 4: Integration Testing ✅
