080502 - Phase 2: Manual verification with test container
Action: Boot test container, verify repos directory creation, test external repo clone
Expected:
  1. .swe-swe/repos directory exists with correct ownership (not root)
  2. Clone external repository succeeds without "permission denied" error

080531 - Observation: swe-swe init creates repos and worktrees directories
Result: ls -la shows repos and worktrees dirs with app:app ownership (not root)
  drwxr-xr-x  2 app app 4096 Jan 29 08:05 repos
  drwxr-xr-x  2 app app 4096 Jan 29 08:05 worktrees
Continuing to build and run container for full verification...

080703 - Browser test: Reproduced the original error
Result: Got "Failed to create directory: mkdir /repos/github.com-choonkeat-tiny-form-fields: permission denied"
Note: This is expected - the test container was initialized BEFORE my fix (from dist binary)
      Need to rebuild dist binary and re-run init to verify the fix
Action: Rebuild binary and re-initialize test container

081314 - Fix corrected: repos/worktrees directories now created in workspace/.swe-swe/ (not sweDir)
Verification:
  - ls -la /workspace/.test-repos/swe-swe-test-0/.swe-swe/ shows:
    drwxr-xr-x 2 app app 4096 Jan 29 08:11 repos
    drwxr-xr-x 2 app app 4096 Jan 29 08:11 worktrees
  - Both directories have app:app ownership (not root:root)

Browser test results:
  1. Clicked "New Session" button
  2. Selected "Clone external repository"
  3. Entered URL: https://github.com/choonkeat/tiny-form-fields.git
  4. Clicked "Next" - NO ERROR! Branch dropdown became enabled
  5. Clicked second "Next" - Session creation flow completed successfully

EXPECTED: Branch dropdown enabled, no "permission denied" error
OBSERVED: Branch dropdown enabled, no error - FIX VERIFIED

Phase 2 complete: Manual verification successful
