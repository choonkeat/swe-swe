084616 - STEP 2: Running 'make test' to verify no tests break
Expected: All tests pass
084720 - Observed: Test FAILED
Got: TestResolveWorkingDirectory/external_with_branch and external_with_hierarchical_branch failed
The tests expected old 'worktree' (singular) but got new 'worktrees' (plural)
Need to update test expectations in worktree_test.go
