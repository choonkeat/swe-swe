231341 - Bug 1 Investigation Complete
What will be done: Add visual affordances to make session name clickable/discoverable
Expected outcome:
- Session name should have cursor:pointer on hover
- Session name should have subtle hover effect (color change or underline)
- An edit icon should appear on hover to indicate editability
- Clicking should open the rename prompt (already works, just not discoverable)

Investigation findings:
- Session naming is NOT broken - functionality works via:
  1. ?name= URL parameter
  2. Settings panel input field
  3. Click-to-rename on session name span
- The issue is purely discoverability - no visual affordance that it's clickable
- Key files: terminal-ui.js (line 1386 - click handler), terminal-ui.css (needs styling)
