044543 - Starting Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
044543 - Step 4.1: Create test app and E2E tests
       - Will: Create integration tests that verify full flow
       - Expect: Tests verify injection, WebSocket communication, and agent queries
044654 - E2E tests implemented
       - Added: TestE2EProxyIntegration - verifies all components work together
       - Added: TestDebugHubForwarding - tests safe forwarding with nil/empty connections
       - Added: TestDebugEndpointPaths - verifies endpoint paths match between JS and Go
       - Note: Full E2E with actual proxy server and browser would require test container
              Manual testing documented in task file for Phase 4
       - Result: All tests PASS (make test-server succeeds)
       - Total tests added across all phases: 12 new test functions
