105320 - Phase 1 Step 1: Add proxy subcommand skeleton
Action: Create cmd/swe-swe/proxy.go with basic subcommand, add "proxy" case to main.go switch statement
Expected: `swe-swe proxy` without args shows usage error, `swe-swe proxy echo` is recognized (will error on missing implementation)
105408 - Phase 1 Step 1: Result
Observed: Build succeeded. `swe-swe proxy` (no args) shows usage and exits 1. `swe-swe proxy echo` is recognized, prints TODO message, exits 0.
Got: As expected - proxy subcommand skeleton working.

105444 - Phase 1 Step 2: Implement PID file management
Action: Add PID file check/creation in proxy.go. Check if existing PID is alive (signal 0), fail fast if running, clean stale.
Expected: Running proxy twice fails with "already running" error. Stale PID file gets cleaned up.
