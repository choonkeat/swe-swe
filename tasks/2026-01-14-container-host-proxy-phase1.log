105320 - Phase 1 Step 1: Add proxy subcommand skeleton
Action: Create cmd/swe-swe/proxy.go with basic subcommand, add "proxy" case to main.go switch statement
Expected: `swe-swe proxy` without args shows usage error, `swe-swe proxy echo` is recognized (will error on missing implementation)
105408 - Phase 1 Step 1: Result
Observed: Build succeeded. `swe-swe proxy` (no args) shows usage and exits 1. `swe-swe proxy echo` is recognized, prints TODO message, exits 0.
Got: As expected - proxy subcommand skeleton working.

105444 - Phase 1 Step 2: Implement PID file management
Action: Add PID file check/creation in proxy.go. Check if existing PID is alive (signal 0), fail fast if running, clean stale.
Expected: Running proxy twice fails with "already running" error. Stale PID file gets cleaned up.
105654 - Phase 1 Step 2: Result
Observed:
- Initial build had bug: strconv.Atoi fails on "1\n" (newline in file). Fixed by adding strings.TrimSpace.
- Duplicate detection: Created PID file with running background process PID -> "proxy for 'echo' already running (PID xxx)" error, exits 1.
- Stale cleanup: Created PID file with 999999 -> "Removing stale PID file" message, continues normally.
- PID file cleanup on exit: After proxy exits, PID file is removed (defer os.Remove works).
Got: As expected after fixing TrimSpace bug. PID file management working correctly.

105731 - Phase 1 Step 3: Set up fsnotify watcher
Action: Add github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify dependency, implement file watcher for *.req files in proxy directory.
Expected: Proxy starts and waits, detects when .req files are created/moved into directory.
