074254 Starting Phase 4: Graceful Shutdown
074254 Step 4.1: Replace simple cancel() with staged shutdown (grace period -> kill)
074254 Expected: On SIGTERM/SIGINT, proxy stops accepting new requests, waits for grace period, then kills remaining
074536 Observed: All tests pass (TestStopAccepting, TestRejectRequest, TestGracefulShutdown_RejectsWhenShuttingDown, TestGracefulShutdown_WaitsForCompletion, TestGracefulShutdown_KillsAfterDeadline)
074536 Got: PASS - Implemented staged shutdown with:
074536   - stopAccepting atomic.Bool flag to reject new requests during shutdown
074536   - rejectRequest() function writes error files (125:shutdown exit code)
074536   - Signal handler waits for activeRequests to reach 0
074536   - Deadline timer kills remaining processes with killAllInFlight()
074536 Note: Tests verify request rejection during shutdown and process killing after deadline

074536 Phase 4 COMPLETE
