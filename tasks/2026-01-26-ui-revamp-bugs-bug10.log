Bug 10: Shell Panel Shows Redundant Header When Embedded

=== Investigation ===
[103600] Starting investigation of Bug 10
- What will be done: Find where iframe embedding is detected and hide panel header when embedded
- Expected: Panel header should be hidden when terminal-ui is inside an iframe
- Current: Panel header shows "Agent Terminal [SHELL (safe)]" even when embedded

[103601] Root cause identified:
- terminal-ui already adds `embedded-in-iframe` class when inside iframe
- CSS rule at line 282-288 hides header, terminal-bar, status-bar but NOT panel-header
- Additionally, mobile view uses `!important` to show `.mobile-only` elements

=== Implementation ===
[103700] Fix implemented:
1. Added `.terminal-ui__panel-header` to the embedded-in-iframe hide rule
2. Added `.mobile-only` to the same rule (iframe is narrow, triggers mobile view)
3. Added `!important` to ensure rules override mobile media query

=== Verification ===
[103800] Browser verification via dev server (make run):
- Navigated to http://swe-swe:3000/session/newtest?assistant=claude&preview
- Clicked Terminal tab to load embedded terminal-ui
- Verified embedded-in-iframe class is applied: true
- Verified terminal-bar display: none
- Verified panel-header display: none
- Visual confirmation: No redundant header visible in embedded terminal

[103801] Verification PASSED:
- Embedded terminal-ui no longer shows panel header or terminal bar
- Only the terminal input and output are visible
- Clean, non-redundant UI when terminal is in the right panel
