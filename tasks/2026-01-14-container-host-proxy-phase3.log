111600 - Phase 3: Error Handling & Cleanup
Note: Steps 1, 3, 5 were already implemented in Phase 1-2. Phase 3 adds:
- Orphan file cleanup on startup
- In-flight request handling with sync.WaitGroup

111610 - Phase 3 Step 2 (enhancement): In-flight request handling
Action: Add sync.WaitGroup to track in-flight requests, wait for completion on shutdown
Expected: When SIGTERM received during command execution, proxy waits for completion
Observed:
- Added sync.WaitGroup in main event loop
- wg.Add(1) before processing request in goroutine
- wg.Done() via defer after request completes
- wg.Wait() on context cancellation
Got: As expected. In-flight requests now complete before shutdown.

111630 - Phase 3 Step 4: Orphan file cleanup
Action: Add cleanupOrphanFiles() function called on startup
Expected: Old .stdout/.stderr/.exit files (>5min) removed, recent and non-response files kept
111700 - Phase 3 Step 4: Result
Observed:
- cleanupOrphanFiles scans proxy directory on startup
- Removes .stdout, .stderr, .exit files older than 5 minutes
- Preserves .req files, scripts, PID files, and recent response files
- Logs each removed orphan with age
Got: As expected. Orphan cleanup working.

111715 - Phase 3 Tests
Action: Add TestCleanupOrphanFiles_* tests to proxy_test.go
Expected: All tests pass via `make test`
111730 - Phase 3 Tests: Result
Observed:
- TestCleanupOrphanFiles_RemovesOldOrphans: verifies old orphans deleted
- TestCleanupOrphanFiles_KeepsRecentFiles: verifies recent files kept
- TestCleanupOrphanFiles_IgnoresNonOrphanFiles: verifies .req, scripts, PID kept
- TestCleanupOrphanFiles_EmptyDirectory: verifies no panic on empty dir
- TestCleanupOrphanFiles_NonExistentDirectory: verifies no panic on missing dir
- All tests pass
Got: As expected. Phase 3 complete.
